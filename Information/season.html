In France, it premiered on December 12, 2015.<br><br>The first season focuses on the premise's basic features of the show before moving on to the advanced features after this season; these features include: having the show to majorly focus on Tarabiscoville than the show's other newer discovered locations, almost every episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") beginning and ending in the day, showcasing what main motives and personalities the three primary villains have before moving on to their minor motives and moving away from their focus of their traits and all of the episode titles have a hero's name, instead of keeping it omitted or having a villain's name in the episode title.<br><br>Season 1's focus is mainly about the introduction of the PJ Masks and their motive on stopping the villains from causing any trouble. It should be noted on a meeting with Christian De Vita, he confirmed that a villain named Firefly was intended to appear in this season. But she was scrapped until the producers find a possible use for her later in the series.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Blame it on the Train, Owlette," marks the Season 1 premiere and is the first episode of the book's television adaptation. Said episodes are also the first episodes to air in 2015.
This episode features Luna Girl's first appearance.</li>
<li>She also appears to show her strongest portrayal of anger than the rest of the series (except for "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum"), screaming multiple times due to Owlette and Gekko helping Catboy to evade chase from the clouds summoned by Luna Girl.</li>
<li>This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create "La Legende des Pyjamasques," while it explores on the backstory of the book counterparts of the onscreen characters and incorporates Luna's temper tantrums to create Sorceline's all-angry personality.</li>
<li>This episode also features the moths' and Alley Cat first appearance.</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl does a tango with Catboy while fighting over the Luna Magnet. It is uncertain if this was on purpose or not.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Catboy is afraid of water, referencing a stereotype of cats.</li>
<li>This is the first episode of Season 1 that focuses on Catboy.</li>
<li>When Catboy realizes his mistake and finds out how much the other PJs need him, he can be heard saying, "I hate getting wet, but not as much as I hate letting my friends down." This is the first use of the word "hate" in PJ Masks, which could be suggestive/inappropriate for some viewers.</li>
<li>Many of the elements and storyline in the episode are reused and inspired to create "La Légende des Pyjamasques" for the backstory for Les Pyjamasques.</li>

<li>Connor playing a joke on Amaya that ends up scaring her is similar to Cat Noir's civilian form Adrien playing a prank on Ladybug's civilian form Marinette in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "The Puppeteer 2."

<li>During the Narrator's introduction sequence, Gekko's voice was cleverly muted due to it being stolen by Romeo.</li>
<li>This is the first time Romeo gets zapped by his own inventions.</li>
<li>The episode also shows the strongest portrayal of Romeo's smug attitude on trying to look great on everything with compliments from other people. This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro for the introduction of Roméo's new motive based on his television counterpart's compliments and Greg's hatred for reciting poetry.</li>
<li>This is one of the first episodes that aired on Disney XD during the January 2022 season.</li>
<li>In two scenes, Romeo is seen without any legs. These two scenes can be seen in the gallery page for this episode.</li>
<li>In the transformation sequence, as Gekko's voice was muted due to Romeo stealing it, Lionel's gurgling noise is muted by mistake. And this error would remain in later episodes starting with the next episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") until the premiere of Season 2.</li>
<li>However, this error was fixed with a French voice actor voicing Lionel in the French version of the show. Despite Gekko's voice being muted in the transformation sequence, his voice in the transformation sequence was unmuted in the French dub.</li>

<p>By day, Connor, Greg, and Amaya were playing frisbee, but Connor's frisbee went into his garden. So once he got it, Greg and Amaya disappeared. By night, Catboy goes out to search for his friends, and thinks that they are being controlled by Romeo. He then discovers they are robot clones who Romeo calls "Robo-Owl" and "Robo-Gekko," while the real Greg and Amaya are being locked in hanging cages. They tried to get Catboy to get them out, but he is overprotective and claims that they don't stand a chance without their superpowers. The robots have all the powers of the originals, plus the added ability of firing energy beams out of their eyes. Robo-Gekko manages to steal the Cat-Car away from Catboy. Meanwhile, Greg borrows Amaya's pink wing hairpins, and uses it to remove the screws holding the cage together. Catboy tries to figure out how to get the pajamas back, which are necessary for accessing the PJ Mask powers. We do not know why the PJ's are required for the PJ Masks to activate their powers. Romeo does not explain how he got the pajamas, but this indicates that he is aware of their civilian identities, and home locations. He mentions he spent 2 years building a Super Computer to power the robots, but it is not clear if he has been battling the PJ Masks for that long or if he began building the computer for a different reason.</p>

<h4>Trivia</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this episode, Romeo introduces Robo-Cat, Robo-Owl, and Robo-Gekko, powered by the Super Computer.</li>
<li>This is the first time that only one member of the PJ Masks headed to HQ.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Romeo knew the PJ Masks' real identities and names the whole time.</li>
<li>Romeo says that Catboy wouldn't be able to tell the robots apart from the real PJ Masks. However, he most likely would, because the robots act more robotic, and have mechanized voices. This still somehow fools Catboy, though.</li>
<li>In this episode, an alternate version of the transformation sequence lyrics can be heard. However, in the French dub, this isn't included and kept the French-language lyrics of the transformation sequence. This is the first time Lionel doesn't appear in the transformation sequence. The transformation sequence also edits out Owlette and Gekko from being seen in the sequence. However, their parts of the sequence are featured near the end of the episode.</li>
<li>This is the first episode with the word "Vs." in the title.</li>
<li>Romeo capturing Connor's friends while he was a short distance away from them off-screen is similar to Shadow Moth using Sentibubbler to capture Rena Rouge's civilian form's friends and family off-screen while she was a short distance away from them in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "Sentibubbler."</li>

<p>The three friends are excited for the loop-de-loop airplane show, but two adults tell them it's been cancelled because the planes were stolen. Amaya is confident that she'd stop the villain with her amazing flying skills. In the night, Night Ninja is flying around with the planes. Owlette tries to stop the planes with the Owl-Glider, but Night Ninja makes her crash and breaks the Owl-Glider. Catboy and Gekko try to convince their friend to go after him without her vehicle, but she doesn't have enough confidence because she thought she wasn't as good a flier as Night Ninja, due to her crash. Owlette struggles to share a plan with Catboy and Gekko because she thought Night Ninja would beat them again, but her friends finally encourage her with support and they get the planes from Night Ninja.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Slow Down, Catboy!," serves as the Season 1 finale. Along with its sister episode, it is also the only episode to premiere in 2017.</li>
<li>This episode likely takes place after the events of the episode "Gekko and the Rock of All Power" since Amaya asks why they're going back to the museum after seeing the Rock of All Power the day before.</li>
<li>This episode is the last episode of Season 1 focusing on Gekko, as well as the last episode of Season 1 to feature Luna Girl and her moths as the primary villains.</li>
<li>The train from "Blame it on the Train, Owlette" makes its third appearance when Luna Girl was testing out her Luna Magnet's acquired strength from the stolen moon rocks.

Its first appearance was in the aforementioned episode, and the second was in "Owlette's New Move."</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl did not appear to understand the logic that the moon could not be pulled out of the sky, as she focused too much on her desire to have it all to herself.</li>
<li>If Luna Girl was not stopped from pulling the moon to Earth, she would have caused armies of tsunamis and high rising tides that would devastate the Earth.</li>
<li>This is the last episode where Jacob Ewaniuk and Tristan Samuel voice Catboy and Cameron, respectively.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 2</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Season 2 is the second season of PJ Masks. On June 13, 2016, sources confirmed that a second season had been greenlit. It premiered in the United States on January 15, 2018, and finished premiering on March 22, 2019. It premiered in France on March 10, 2018.</p>
<p>The second season will now start to focus on the premise's advanced features of the show: The season will now focus on newcomer heroes and villains, such as Armadylan, An Yu (minorly; in her dragon form), the Wolfy Kids, and PJ Robot. The Moon and Mystery Mountain are now introduced as new, undiscovered locations. New powers are introduced to the PJ Masks, but these new powers are actually Les Pyjamasques' powers which were already introduced in "Les Pyjamasques et la graine d'Orticia" before the airing of the second season. There will now be episodes ending immediately after the PJ Masks' signature phrase. From now on, there will no longer be any fading-in or fading-out transitions of an episode, as new transitions such as the episode cutting in and cutting out are introduced. The villains' motives (except for Romeo) are expanded to relate to the new locations introduced in the second season. Episode name titles featuring a hero's name has been slightly toned down to now feature title cards without their name or with a villain's name. Episodes featuring more than one villain has been toned up slightly.</p>
<p>Starting with this season, the animation becomes smoother and more high-quality, which would gradually progress as the series goes on. However, there are some scenes that have the same animation quality as Season 1's, the prominent example being the transformation sequence. The smoother animation has first been demonstrated in the Shorts, which have started airing back in July 2017.</p>

The new powers are: Super Cat Stripes for Catboy, Super Owl Feathers for Owlette, Super Gekko Shield for Gekko, however, the new powers that the PJ Masks got are actually Les Pyjamasques' powers who already had these new powers before the PJ Masks, which means this episode is chronologically set after Les Pyjamasques et la graine d'Orticia.

<li>This is the third time that Night Ninja works with the PJ Masks, but it happened later, since they acted neutral and attempted to give advice to Night Ninja and the Wolfy Kids on sharing Mystery Mountain. The first two times were in "Ninja Moths" and "Romeo's Disguise."</li>
<li>In this episode, the Ninjalinos are revealed to have names when Night Ninja called the Ninjalino that hurt his leg, Marvin. The Ninjalino that was known as Marvin is also known as Maxime in the French version.</li>
<li>Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos meet the Wolfy Kids - Howler, Rip and Kevin - for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the first episode to focus on Night Ninja.</li>
<li>In one scene, Night Ninja mentions the Mystery Mountain Scroll from "Race Up Mystery Mountain" that the PJ Masks never got back from. This references the PJs' first-ever failure from Mystery Mountain's debut episode, though the PJs themselves no longer worry about the scroll in the entire TV series, and the museum presumably has a fake duplicate of it on display.</li>

<li>This serves as the PJ Masks' Halloween episode. This is also the second special episode of the series.</li>
<li>This is where the PJ Masks and others are celebrating Halloween.</li>
<li>This is the first episode where five nighttime villains appear.</li>
<li>This is the first time that the Wolfy Kids, Luna Girl and Night Ninja teamed up together. So far, this episode features the largest villain team-up, making for a total of 5 villains. Romeo is the only villain not to appear in this episode.</li>
<li>Chronologically, Night Ninja meets the Wolfy Kids for the first time.</li>
<li>Cameron and the other kids finally meet the PJ Masks, but are unaware of their true identities and the fact that they are superheroes.
The PJ Masks deepen their voices so the kids won't know who they really are. They also meet the nighttime villains, but they think they're just bad kids. However, Cameron thinks the PJ Masks are also bad kids.</li>
<li>This is the first time Cameron makes his major appearance.</li>
<li>Luna Girl uses her Luna Magnet to make her moths grow giant for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the third episode where there is no daytime. The previous two were "Moonbreaker" and "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
<li>At one point, Luna Girl goes to HQ and wonders if the place has a doorbell. It could be possible that either she forgot about it or this episode is chronologically set before "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>The PJ Masks use different catchphrases in this episode: "PJ Masks, let's go as a team. Into the night, to save Halloween" and "PJ Masks, we're a super team. Cause in the night, we saved Halloween."</li>
<li>This episode reveals that HQ has a feature to scare villains.</li>
<li>This is the second time that the daytime kids appear in the night, along with Cameron. The first time Cameron appeared in the night was in "Gekko and the Snore-A-Saurus" when he was sleep walking, while the other kids appeared for the first time in "Moonfizzle Balls."</li>
<li>On Netflix, this episode is listed to chronologically take place as the intended Season 2 episode finale. Therefore, it is very likely that Luna Girl seems to have forgotten about HQ's doorbell despite the events of "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>In regards to Part 2, no one reads the title of an episode for the first time. However, the French dub of the episode's second part is shown to be the only exception.</li>
<li>This is the fourth time that violence is directly referenced or seen in the whole book series and TV series together. The first three times this theme was referenced was in "Les Pyjamasques et Utupë, l'esprit de la forêt" and "Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro," as well as "The Mountain Prisoner."</li>
<li>Luna Girl's moth grows big for the second time. The first time was in "Super-Sized Gekko."</li>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Romeo introduces the Opposite Ray.</li>
  <li>In one scene, Romeo (as Captain Smarty Pants) said "It's time to be a hero," but he only proclaimed that phrase in the French dub of the show, as it is replaced with "Okay super buddy, let's take these villains down!" in the English dub. Also in the English dub, no one says "Time to be a hero" or "It's time to be a hero" for the fourth time.</li>
  <li>Catboy and Owlette are brainwashed and turned into villains with the names "Night Panther" and "Dark Owl" by Romeo with his Opposite Ray. In the French version, however, their names were "Tigre Noir" (Black Tiger) and "Merlette" (Black Bird Owl) to reflect on their physical appearances. Dark Owl is a reference to a villain named Dark Owl in the show Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Chat Noir, specifically in the episode named "The Dark Owl." Night Panther's name is a direct reference to the hero named Black Panther from the comics made by Marvel. Romeo is also brainwashed and turned into a good guy with the name "Captain Smarty Pants" by Gekko when he used his Super Gekko Shield to block the ray's blast. Like Night Panther and Dark Owl's names being changed in the French version of the episode, he is known as "Capitaine Super-Malice" (Captain Super Malice). Captain Smarty Pants' name is a direct reference to the superhero named Captain America from the comics made by Marvel. Although Catboy and Owlette are corrupted into "Night Panther" and "Dark Owl," they are still referred to by their normal nighttime alter-ego names at least twice (three times in the French dub) by Gekko until Romeo is brainwashed and turned into a good guy. While "Captain Smarty Pants" is referred to by his villain name by Owlette when Robot turned him back into Romeo.</li>
  <li>This is the fifth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous four times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," and "PJ Dylan."</li>
  <li>Romeo dejects Robot the second time. The first time he dejected him was in "Armadylan'd and Dangerous."</li>
  <li>This episode also shows that Gekko is good at convincing Owlette and Catboy that they are heroes.</li>
  <li>This is the first time a villain is seen leaving after the PJ Masks chant their victory.</li>
  <li>This is the second time Catboy & Owlette get taken over by one of Romeo's inventions. The first was in "Terrible Two-Some," where Catboy and Owlette acted like babies after being zapped by Romeo's Baby Beam.</li>
  <li>In some scenes of the episode's French dub, Night Panther's voice sounds reminiscent to Catboy's Season 1 French voice, albeit with a deeper voice.</li>
  <li>Romeo says Gekko's name for the first time.</li>

  <h4>Trivia</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>This is the first episode to focus on Romeo, Luna Girl, and Night Ninja all at the same time.</li>
  <li>The Wolfy Kids are the only trio of villains not to appear in this episode.</li>
  <li>This is the seventh episode to focus on the villains.</li>
  <li>This is the first time an episode title involves the name 'PJ Masks'.</li>
  <li>This is the first time Romeo and Luna Girl briefly work together, although they typically dislike each other.</li>
  <li>This is the second time three nighttime villains team up. The first time was in "Halloween Tricksters."</li>
  <li>The PJ Masks were almost defeated by the nighttime villains due to Romeo's gadgets, Luna Girl's Luna Magnet and Night Ninja's Sticky Splats being super-charged with the Mega-Moonstone, but Armadylan came to save them.</li>
  <li>Night Ninja says Romeo's name for the first time.</li>
  <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 2 focusing on Armadylan as well as the last episode of Season 2 that features Romeo, Robot, Night Ninja and the Ninjalinos as four of the primary villains.</li>
  <li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous five times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," "PJ Dylan" and "Gekko and the Opposite Ray."</li>
  <li>Armadylan says Night Ninja and Luna Girl's full names for the first time.</li>
  <li>Luna Girl says Armadylan's name for the first time.</li>
  <li>This is the third time Armadylan narrates an episode title. The previous two times were in "Nobody's Sidekick" and "Armadylan'd and Dangerous." This is averted in the French dub where Catboy narrates the episode instead.</li>
  <li>In the French version of the episode, the Sniff-O-Whiff was referred to as "The Famous **** of Roméo." This is one of the few uses of swearing in PJ Masks, which international viewers may find suggestive/inappropriate due to cultural differences. Another instance of swearing in the French version of the episode is after the PJ Masks were freed by Armadylan, Romeo reacted by saying "We're *******, all at the shelters each good under!".</li>
  <li>This is the third episode with the word "Vs." in the title. The first was "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat." The second was "Gekko Vs. the Splatcano."</li>
  <li>This is Armadylan's final appearance in Season 2.</li>

  <ul>
  <li>This episode, along with "Luna and the Wolfies," serves as the Season 2 finale.</li>
  <li>This episode is the last episode of Season 2 focusing on Owlette, as well as the last episode of Season 2 to feature Luna Girl, her Moths and the Wolfy Kids as the primary villains.</li>
  <li>This is the second time the PJ Masks, Rip and Howler work together. The first was in "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>This is the third time the PJ Masks and Kevin work together. The first was in "The Good Wolfy," and the second was in "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>This is the first time Luna Girl gives her Luna Magnet to a villain. However, she does it to trick the Wolfy Kids.</li>
  <li>Luna Girl introduces her backup moon crystal. The episode reveals that the backup moon crystal is the third moon crystal.</li>
  <li>Kevin moves his bangs for the first time.</li>
  <li>The Wolfies don't know Luna Girl, thus allowing her to trick them into thinking she's the queen of the moon. So most likely, this episode is set before the episodes "Halloween Tricksters," "The Lizard Theft," and "Romeocoaster," in which Luna and the Wolfies already met. On Netflix, this could be evident as this episode along with "Easter Wolfies" is listed to chronologically take place after the events of "The Wolfy Kids" and "Wolf-O-Saurus," and before the events of "Halloween Tricksters," "The Lizard Theft," and "Romeocoaster."</li>
  <li>PJ Robot drives the Owl-Glider for the first time.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 3</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Season 3 is the third season of PJ Masks. The sources confirmed and announced the third season on January 22, 2018, a week after Season 2 premiered. It was intended to be set to premiere in June 2019, but according to sources it was then pushed forward to April 19, and finished premiering on March 13, 2020. It premiered in France on August 30, 2019.</p>
<p>The third season majorly focuses on the temporary transformation of already-existing characters; these characters would be Teeny Weeny and Kevin (briefly). The season also introduces the evolved characters: Motsuki and An Yu (who technically first appeared in the previous season via "The Dragon Gong"). As of this season and onwards, an addition of new characters from the picture book series such as Santa Claus now appear in the television series, in order to stay faithful with the book series. The episode "Gekko Everywhere" also foreshadows the upcoming Season 4 villain: Octobella. This also covers vehicles such as Romeo's Sky Factory, the PJ Seeker and the Wolf Wheelz.</p>
<p>The episodes that end in the day are toned down drastically to the point where there's almost no episodes with this feature. In a similar fashion, episode title cards that feature a PJ Masks' name has been toned down to the point where there are almost no episode titles mentioning a hero's name.</p>
<p>It is noticed in some scenes where an episode begins in the night, the PJ Masks no longer wear their pajamas before the transformation and now wear their daytime outfits. This was previously seen in Season 2, but it wasn't as frequent than Season 3.</p>
<p>Starting with "Moon Madness," Season 3 also seems to majorly focus on crystals. Luna Girl starts to be called by her nickname, "Luna," more than her full name.</p>
<p>As of this season and onwards, the episode title cards are no longer color-coded depending on what character is focusing. The title cards will now always be highlighted blue (with the exception of "Lionel's Powers" for this season, as it is highlighted green).</p>
<p>As of this season and onwards, the intensity of the missions the PJ Masks faced in some of the episodes toned down to feature little or no fighting sequences and focused more on the main problem in most parts of the episode. It also featured plotlines that wouldn't normally happen as part of the series' premise, as well as parts of the plotlines that look unnecessary and pointless. In response to these flaws of the series, some of the viewers disliked certain episodes that had those aspects.</p>

  <ul>
<li>This episode marks the Season 3 premiere.</li>
<li>At the end of the episode, it fades out instead of cutting out. This is the first time this instance has happened since the Season 1 episode "Gekko's Special Rock," which was the last episode to feature this aspect before the episodes started to cut out, beginning with the Season 2 episode "Moonfizzle Balls."</li>
<li>This episode serves as a continuation of "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon" and "Moonstruck: Lunar Fortress."</li>
<li>This is the third special episode of the series.</li>
<li>This is the first TV-Y7-FV-rated episode of PJ Masks.</li>
<li>Luna Girl is the second villain to steal the moon crystal. The first was Romeo in "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
<li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks and Luna Girl go to the moon. The previous five times were in "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon," "Moonstruck: Lunar Fortress," "Moonbreaker," "Moon Rocked," "Play Date on the Moon" and "Space Race."</li>
<li>This is the first appearance of Motsuki.</li>
<li>The Moon Fortress has grown since "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>Gekko gets his powers stolen for the first time. The first PJ Mask hero who got their powers stolen was Catboy in "Catboy No More." The second was Armadylan in "Armadylan'd and Dangerous."</li>
<li>This is the second time Owlette gets her powers stolen, only this time, they were actually stolen rather than copied.The first time was in "Owlette of a Kind."</li>
<li>This is the second episode to end in a cliffhanger because at the end of the episode, Motsuki tells Luna Girl that the moon crystal survived and is ready for her to take in the future. The first time was "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon."</li>
<li>The moths are the second acolytes that are revealed to have names. The first acolytes to have names were the Ninjalinos as revealed by Night Ninja in "Wolfy Mountain." Luna Girl comes up with a name for Motsuki when they are already on the moon, so Motsuki is most likely the only named moth at the moment.</li>
<li>When Luna Girl fires the moon beam from her Lunar Fortress to the city, the beam can be seen heading for Panama, a country in Central-America. However, this contradicts previous episodes in which the city was suggested to be located in a US or European setting.</li>
<li>This is the second time Owlette uses her Super Feather Shield. The first time it was used was in "Owlette Comes Clean."</li>
<li>This is the sixth time the PJ Masks don't transform back after chanting their victory. The previous five times were in "Gekko Saves Christmas," "Armadylan Menace," "The Lizard Theft," "PJ Dylan," "Gekko and the Opposite Ray" and "PJ Masks Vs. Bad Guys United."</li>
<li>This is the first time PJ Robot says "PJ Masks, all shout hooray!".</li>
<li>This episode shares the same title with the Little Charmers episode of the same name. Little Charmers is another show starring Addison Holley (Owlette's voice actor).</li>
<li>It is revealed that the Luna Wand has a mirror that can spectate what the PJ Masks are doing.</li>
<li>Luna Girl narrates an episode title for the second time. The first was in "Owlette's Luna Trouble." This is averted to have Catboy narrating the episode title in the French dub of the episode.</li>
<li>As of this episode onwards, the title cards will always have the text colored blue (with the exception of "Lionel's Powers" as it was green).</li>

This also marks the second appearance of the harvest moon. The previous time was in "Moonstruck: Race to the Moon."

    <li>The Wolfies are the third villains to discover the PJ Masks' true identities. The previous two are Romeo in "Catboy VS. Robo-Cat" and Night Ninja in "PJ Power Up."</li>
    <li>This is the second time where the PJ Masks turn back to their normal identities after losing their powers to a villain. The first was "PJ Power Up." However, unlike "PJ Power Up," the PJ Masks don't refer by their superhero names, and referred by their civilian names this time.</li>

    <li>An Yu is shown that she already knows the PJ Masks' civilian identities. It is currently unknown how she already discovered their true identities.</li>
    <li>This is the first time that the PJ Masks' transformation scene happens lately, instead of showing the scene early in the episode, unlike most of previous episodes.

    <li>This is the second time Cameron makes his major appearance. The first time he makes his major appearance in "Halloween Tricksters."</li>
    <li>This is the second time Cameron and the other kids meet the PJ Masks. However, unlike the events of "Halloween Tricksters," the PJ Masks don't act casual anymore on disguising their voices, and had said their superhero identities right near the civilians for the first time, but the other kids still don't know who they really are. Though, none of the kids didn't know who the PJ Masks are really are, but it's pointed out that one of the unnamed kids recognized Gekko's "Do the Gekko" dance before and after he transformed into his alter-ego, and it would had possibly almost lead Gekko's real identity to be discovered.</li>

    <li>An Yu learns a new word for the third time. This time, the word is "disco." The first word she learned was "high five" in "Meet An Yu" and the second word she learned was "party" in the short "PJ Masks Surprise."</li>
    <li>This is the sixth time An Yu joins in the PJ Masks' victory phrase.</li>
    <li>This is the last episode where Devan Cohen voices Night Ninja. Night Ninja's voice is noticeably deeper in this episode due to Devan Cohen going through puberty.</li>
