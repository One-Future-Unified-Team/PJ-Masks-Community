In France, it premiered on December 12, 2015.<br><br>The first season focuses on the premise's basic features of the show before moving on to the advanced features after this season; these features include: having the show to majorly focus on Tarabiscoville than the show's other newer discovered locations, almost every episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") beginning and ending in the day, showcasing what main motives and personalities the three primary villains have before moving on to their minor motives and moving away from their focus of their traits and all of the episode titles have a hero's name, instead of keeping it omitted or having a villain's name in the episode title.<br><br>Season 1's focus is mainly about the introduction of the PJ Masks and their motive on stopping the villains from causing any trouble. It should be noted on a meeting with Christian De Vita, he confirmed that a villain named Firefly was intended to appear in this season. But she was scrapped until the producers find a possible use for her later in the series.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Blame it on the Train, Owlette," marks the Season 1 premiere and is the first episode of the book's television adaptation. Said episodes are also the first episodes to air in 2015.
This episode features Luna Girl's first appearance.</li>
<li>She also appears to show her strongest portrayal of anger than the rest of the series (except for "Luna's Cosmic Tantrum"), screaming multiple times due to Owlette and Gekko helping Catboy to evade chase from the clouds summoned by Luna Girl.</li>
<li>This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create "La Legende des Pyjamasques," while it explores on the backstory of the book counterparts of the onscreen characters and incorporates Luna's temper tantrums to create Sorceline's all-angry personality.</li>
<li>This episode also features the moths' and Alley Cat first appearance.</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl does a tango with Catboy while fighting over the Luna Magnet. It is uncertain if this was on purpose or not.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Catboy is afraid of water, referencing a stereotype of cats.</li>
<li>This is the first episode of Season 1 that focuses on Catboy.</li>
<li>When Catboy realizes his mistake and finds out how much the other PJs need him, he can be heard saying, "I hate getting wet, but not as much as I hate letting my friends down." This is the first use of the word "hate" in PJ Masks, which could be suggestive/inappropriate for some viewers.</li>
<li>Many of the elements and storyline in the episode are reused and inspired to create "La Légende des Pyjamasques" for the backstory for Les Pyjamasques.</li>

<li>Connor playing a joke on Amaya that ends up scaring her is similar to Cat Noir's civilian form Adrien playing a prank on Ladybug's civilian form Marinette in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "The Puppeteer 2."

<li>During the Narrator's introduction sequence, Gekko's voice was cleverly muted due to it being stolen by Romeo.</li>
<li>This is the first time Romeo gets zapped by his own inventions.</li>
<li>The episode also shows the strongest portrayal of Romeo's smug attitude on trying to look great on everything with compliments from other people. This encouraged Romuald Racioppo to create a book adaptation of the episode by reusing elements and storyline in the episode to create Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro for the introduction of Roméo's new motive based on his television counterpart's compliments and Greg's hatred for reciting poetry.</li>
<li>This is one of the first episodes that aired on Disney XD during the January 2022 season.</li>
<li>In two scenes, Romeo is seen without any legs. These two scenes can be seen in the gallery page for this episode.</li>
<li>In the transformation sequence, as Gekko's voice was muted due to Romeo stealing it, Lionel's gurgling noise is muted by mistake. And this error would remain in later episodes starting with the next episode (except for "Gekko Saves Christmas") until the premiere of Season 2.</li>
<li>However, this error was fixed with a French voice actor voicing Lionel in the French version of the show. Despite Gekko's voice being muted in the transformation sequence, his voice in the transformation sequence was unmuted in the French dub.</li>

<p>By day, Connor, Greg, and Amaya were playing frisbee, but Connor's frisbee went into his garden. So once he got it, Greg and Amaya disappeared. By night, Catboy goes out to search for his friends, and thinks that they are being controlled by Romeo. He then discovers they are robot clones who Romeo calls "Robo-Owl" and "Robo-Gekko," while the real Greg and Amaya are being locked in hanging cages. They tried to get Catboy to get them out, but he is overprotective and claims that they don't stand a chance without their superpowers. The robots have all the powers of the originals, plus the added ability of firing energy beams out of their eyes. Robo-Gekko manages to steal the Cat-Car away from Catboy. Meanwhile, Greg borrows Amaya's pink wing hairpins, and uses it to remove the screws holding the cage together. Catboy tries to figure out how to get the pajamas back, which are necessary for accessing the PJ Mask powers. We do not know why the PJ's are required for the PJ Masks to activate their powers. Romeo does not explain how he got the pajamas, but this indicates that he is aware of their civilian identities, and home locations. He mentions he spent 2 years building a Super Computer to power the robots, but it is not clear if he has been battling the PJ Masks for that long or if he began building the computer for a different reason.</p>

<h4>Trivia</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this episode, Romeo introduces Robo-Cat, Robo-Owl, and Robo-Gekko, powered by the Super Computer.</li>
<li>This is the first time that only one member of the PJ Masks headed to HQ.</li>
<li>This episode reveals that Romeo knew the PJ Masks' real identities and names the whole time.</li>
<li>Romeo says that Catboy wouldn't be able to tell the robots apart from the real PJ Masks. However, he most likely would, because the robots act more robotic, and have mechanized voices. This still somehow fools Catboy, though.</li>
<li>In this episode, an alternate version of the transformation sequence lyrics can be heard. However, in the French dub, this isn't included and kept the French-language lyrics of the transformation sequence. This is the first time Lionel doesn't appear in the transformation sequence. The transformation sequence also edits out Owlette and Gekko from being seen in the sequence. However, their parts of the sequence are featured near the end of the episode.</li>
<li>This is the first episode with the word "Vs." in the title.</li>
<li>Romeo capturing Connor's friends while he was a short distance away from them off-screen is similar to Shadow Moth using Sentibubbler to capture Rena Rouge's civilian form's friends and family off-screen while she was a short distance away from them in the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir episode "Sentibubbler."</li>

<p>The three friends are excited for the loop-de-loop airplane show, but two adults tell them it's been cancelled because the planes were stolen. Amaya is confident that she'd stop the villain with her amazing flying skills. In the night, Night Ninja is flying around with the planes. Owlette tries to stop the planes with the Owl-Glider, but Night Ninja makes her crash and breaks the Owl-Glider. Catboy and Gekko try to convince their friend to go after him without her vehicle, but she doesn't have enough confidence because she thought she wasn't as good a flier as Night Ninja, due to her crash. Owlette struggles to share a plan with Catboy and Gekko because she thought Night Ninja would beat them again, but her friends finally encourage her with support and they get the planes from Night Ninja.</p>

<ul>
<li>This episode, along with "Slow Down, Catboy!," serves as the Season 1 finale. Along with its sister episode, it is also the only episode to premiere in 2017.</li>
<li>This episode likely takes place after the events of the episode "Gekko and the Rock of All Power" since Amaya asks why they're going back to the museum after seeing the Rock of All Power the day before.</li>
<li>This episode is the last episode of Season 1 focusing on Gekko, as well as the last episode of Season 1 to feature Luna Girl and her moths as the primary villains.</li>
<li>The train from "Blame it on the Train, Owlette" makes its third appearance when Luna Girl was testing out her Luna Magnet's acquired strength from the stolen moon rocks.

Its first appearance was in the aforementioned episode, and the second was in "Owlette's New Move."</li>
<li>In this episode, Luna Girl did not appear to understand the logic that the moon could not be pulled out of the sky, as she focused too much on her desire to have it all to herself.</li>
<li>If Luna Girl was not stopped from pulling the moon to Earth, she would have caused armies of tsunamis and high rising tides that would devastate the Earth.</li>
<li>This is the last episode where Jacob Ewaniuk and Tristan Samuel voice Catboy and Cameron, respectively.</li>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Season 2</button>
<div class="content1">
<p>Season 2 is the second season of PJ Masks. On June 13, 2016, sources confirmed that a second season had been greenlit. It premiered in the United States on January 15, 2018, and finished premiering on March 22, 2019. It premiered in France on March 10, 2018.</p>
<p>The second season will now start to focus on the premise's advanced features of the show: The season will now focus on newcomer heroes and villains, such as Armadylan, An Yu (minorly; in her dragon form), the Wolfy Kids, and PJ Robot. The Moon and Mystery Mountain are now introduced as new, undiscovered locations. New powers are introduced to the PJ Masks, but these new powers are actually Les Pyjamasques' powers which were already introduced in "Les Pyjamasques et la graine d'Orticia" before the airing of the second season. There will now be episodes ending immediately after the PJ Masks' signature phrase. From now on, there will no longer be any fading-in or fading-out transitions of an episode, as new transitions such as the episode cutting in and cutting out are introduced. The villains' motives (except for Romeo) are expanded to relate to the new locations introduced in the second season. Episode name titles featuring a hero's name has been slightly toned down to now feature title cards without their name or with a villain's name. Episodes featuring more than one villain has been toned up slightly.</p>
<p>Starting with this season, the animation becomes smoother and more high-quality, which would gradually progress as the series goes on. However, there are some scenes that have the same animation quality as Season 1's, the prominent example being the transformation sequence. The smoother animation has first been demonstrated in the Shorts, which have started airing back in July 2017.</p>

The new powers are: Super Cat Stripes for Catboy, Super Owl Feathers for Owlette, Super Gekko Shield for Gekko, however, the new powers that the PJ Masks got are actually Les Pyjamasques' powers who already had these new powers before the PJ Masks, which means this episode is chronologically set after Les Pyjamasques et la graine d'Orticia.

<li>This is the third time that Night Ninja works with the PJ Masks, but it happened later, since they acted neutral and attempted to give advice to Night Ninja and the Wolfy Kids on sharing Mystery Mountain. The first two times were in "Ninja Moths" and "Romeo's Disguise."</li>
<li>In this episode, the Ninjalinos are revealed to have names when Night Ninja called the Ninjalino that hurt his leg, Marvin. The Ninjalino that was known as Marvin is also known as Maxime in the French version.</li>
<li>Night Ninja and his Ninjalinos meet the Wolfy Kids - Howler, Rip and Kevin - for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the first episode to focus on Night Ninja.</li>
<li>In one scene, Night Ninja mentions the Mystery Mountain Scroll from "Race Up Mystery Mountain" that the PJ Masks never got back from. This references the PJs' first-ever failure from Mystery Mountain's debut episode, though the PJs themselves no longer worry about the scroll in the entire TV series, and the museum presumably has a fake duplicate of it on display.</li>
<li>The Wolfy Kids become the second villains to be at Mystery Mountain.</li>

<li>This serves as the PJ Masks' Halloween episode. This is also the second special episode of the series.</li>
<li>This is where the PJ Masks and others are celebrating Halloween.</li>
<li>This is the first episode where five nighttime villains appear.</li>
<li>This is the first time that the Wolfy Kids, Luna Girl and Night Ninja teamed up together. So far, this episode features the largest villain team-up, making for a total of 5 villains. Romeo is the only villain not to appear in this episode.</li>
<li>Chronologically, Night Ninja meets the Wolfy Kids for the first time.</li>
<li>Cameron and the other kids finally meet the PJ Masks, but are unaware of their true identities and the fact that they are superheroes.
The PJ Masks deepen their voices so the kids won't know who they really are. They also meet the nighttime villains, but they think they're just bad kids. However, Cameron thinks the PJ Masks are also bad kids.</li>
<li>This is the first time Cameron makes his major appearance.</li>
<li>Luna Girl uses her Luna Magnet to make her moths grow giant for the first time.</li>
<li>This is the third episode where there is no daytime. The previous two were "Moonbreaker" and "Romeo's Crystal Clear Plan."</li>
<li>At one point, Luna Girl goes to HQ and wonders if the place has a doorbell. It could be possible that either she forgot about it or this episode is chronologically set before "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>The PJ Masks use different catchphrases in this episode: "PJ Masks, let's go as a team. Into the night, to save Halloween" and "PJ Masks, we're a super team. Cause in the night, we saved Halloween."</li>
<li>This episode reveals that HQ has a feature to scare villains.</li>
<li>This is the second time that the daytime kids appear in the night, along with Cameron. The first time Cameron appeared in the night was in "Gekko and the Snore-A-Saurus" when he was sleep walking, while the other kids appeared for the first time in "Moonfizzle Balls."</li>
<li>On Netflix, this episode is listed to chronologically take place as the intended Season 2 episode finale. Therefore, it is very likely that Luna Girl seems to have forgotten about HQ's doorbell despite the events of "Moonbreaker."</li>
<li>In regards to Part 2, no one reads the title of an episode for the first time. However, the French dub of the episode's second part is shown to be the only exception.</li>
<li>This is the fourth time that violence is directly referenced or seen in the whole book series and TV series together. The first three times this theme was referenced was in "Les Pyjamasques et Utupë, l'esprit de la forêt" and "Les Pyjamasques et l'opération zéro," as well as "The Mountain Prisoner."</li>
<li>Luna Girl's moth grows big for the second time. The first time was in "Super-Sized Gekko."</li>
